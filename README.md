# WooCommerce Admin - Notice Example

Adds a note to the merchant's inbox showing dummy text and two action buttons.

## What's This?

:warning: It's a simple example of creating your own notice for the new WooCommerce Admin dashboard. It's experimental as the WooCommerce Admin is still in development so this example may change overtime.

## Screenshot

## Prerequisites

[WordPress 5.2 or greater](https://wordpress.org/download/) and [WooCommerce 3.6.0 or greater](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) should be installed prior to activating the WooCommerce Admin feature plugin and this example plugin.

## Dev Notes

In the plugin example you will find commented out lines that you may find useful to use to check things before displaying your notice. Simply uncomment the lines of code you wish to use before activating the plugin.

The plugin activates and runs after WooCommerce Admin has loaded to ensure proper loading order. The notice runs via the `wc_admin_daily` cron schedule which is once a day and `wc_admin_sunday` which is every week on Sunday. It may not show until the next scheduled event. Which ever comes first.

Overtime if you have left this plugin active with no modifications made you will see the notice will eventually be showing more than once. That is because of this line ```WC_Admin_Notes::delete_notes_with_name( self::NOTE_NAME );``` is disabled to demonstrate that each note is unique in the database. I would uncomment it when creating your own note.

You will also notice in the screenshot the icon is different. You can use any icon from the [GridIcons Collection](http://automattic.github.io/gridicons/). You will only need the name of the icon. The icon name I have used in this example is named `reader` to present the note as an article excerpt. The current default admin notes use the following icons: `info`, `product`, `thumbs-up`, `mail` and `mobile`.

You can have up to two action buttons. Depending if you are allowing the note to be snoozable, you can have up to three buttons. The action buttons also have two classes, primary which is the pink one and none primary which is the light grey. Which order you place the action buttons is up to you.

The buttons must link to a WordPress admin page or to an external URL. Leaving the query of the button blank or even using a hashtag `#` will simply redirect the user back to the WordPress Dashboard when the button is clicked on.

Here is the full code snippet of creating a note of your own with this example plugin. Notice the last two variables allow you to make the notice snoozable and set the language of the notice.

```php
self::create_new_note( array(
	'title'     => __( 'My Note Title', 'wc-admin-note-example' ),
	'content'   => __( 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Iam enim adesse poterit. Prodest, inquit, mihi eo esse animo. <strong>Pollicetur certe.</strong> Duo Reges: constructio interrete.', 'wc-admin-note-example' ),
	'icon'      => 'reader',
	'note_name' => self::NOTE_NAME,
	'source'    => 'wc-admin-note-example',
	'actions'   => array(
		array(
			'name'    => 'do-something',
			'label'   => __( 'Click Me', 'wc-admin-note-example' ),
			'query'   => wc_admin_url(),
			'status'  => 'actioned',
			'primary' => false
		),
		array(
			'name'    => 'external-url',
			'label'   => __( 'View Repository', 'wc-admin-note-example' ),
			'query'   => 'https://github.com/seb86/wc-admin-notice-example',
			'status'  => 'actioned',
			'primary' => true
		)
	),
	'is_snoozable' => true,
	'locale'       => 'en_US'
) );
```

Have fun experimenting! üòÑ
